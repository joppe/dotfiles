    -- changed line, or a deleted line. Gitsigns can show these hunks in the
    -- sign column of the buffer. The signs are configurable, and the default
    -- signs are `+` for added lines, `~` for changed lines, and `_` for deleted
    -- lines. The `topdelete` sign is used for the top line of a deleted hunk,
    -- and the `changedelete` sign is used for a line in a hunk that has been
    -- changed and deleted. The `on_attach` function is called when the plugin
    -- is attached to a buffer. It sets up keybindings for navigating between
    -- hunks and previewing hunks.
